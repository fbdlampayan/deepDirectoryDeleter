# deepDirectoryDeleter
This java tool is just a small app to aid the deletion of really deeeeeeeeeep directory structures in Windows. 
Simply input the path you wish to delete and everything is deleted away.

Background:
Deep Directory Deleter aims to aid windows users that has ultra deep directory structures.
Deleting really deep directories in windows is very limited because of the windows explorer's maximum supported length of 260 characters.
To work around this limitation, one must rename the files, or traverse deep within and delete it one by one.
Which was tedious, so I created a java app where I just input the absolute path of the directory I wish to be deleted.
